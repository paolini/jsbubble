Draw your bubbles and see them evolve to a (locally) minimal bubble cluster. 

You can change the target area of each bubble, split them, flip, remove, or collapse edges by selecting
the corresponding tool and clicking on the edge.
You can split a vertex if it has at least four edges.
You can color (fill) the bubble interiors to identify them.
You can show the instantaneous forces (draw forces)
and activate automatic topological changes (auto topology) which means that shrinking edges are flipped.

You can try to change the precision (shorter segments) and the velocity (faster evolution). 
This might lead to instabilities and blow ups.
